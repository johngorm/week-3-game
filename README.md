A Super Smash Bros Themed Hangman game

This was an assignment for class to create a javascript based game of Hangman. We were allowed to choose our theme.

Though the assignment is funcitonal, the style leaves something to be desired. I hope to add more details that will better reflect the Smash Brothers theme. Below are some of my ideas for future updates.

1. Change the number of tries to a percentage that mimics the Smash damage percent. It would increase with each wrong guess and increment up to 100% (the player losses). Perhaps play the sound of character being thrown off-screen.

2. Include a image of the solution that would reveal itself on correct guessing. 

3. A bit of a stretch but incorporate gifs of characters idling and attacking into page. A correct guess would call the player's character attack gif and similarly for the computer character with a wrong guess. 

Hope you enjoy playing!
